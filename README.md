# DailyAdvice

The Daily Advice is a small project that displays short advice. It serves as a practice project for Jetpack Compose. Currently, the advice values and background are placeholders. There are plans to add a server-side component in the future, where advice and photos can be added.

## Features

- Displays short advice.
- Practice project for Jetpack Compose.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred IDE.
3. Build and run the project on an Android device or emulator.

## Usage

## Roadmap

Future updates and improvements planned for the project include:

- Implementing a server-side component to allow adding advice and photos.
- Enhancing the UI with animations and transitions.
- Adding user customization options for advice display.
